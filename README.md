# A simple tank shooting game 
## my javaScript projekt after one month
you have to cross the blocks and shooting the stars to get more score in a specific time (1 minute)
   - 1. you can use the space Button to shooting 
     2. right and left to avoid hitting the blocks 
     3. up and down arrows to control the speed
     
     
     the worke plan was:
     to divide the projekt into parts there is no specific time for each part they just come after eache other 
     first part was after the idea to draw the images
     then put the condition of the game and the movement 
     starting to programing and checking each part of the game
